Download `wk2_SPY.csv` from Canvas. The data contain historical prices and volume for S&P 500 index (SPY) from the web. Read it into `R`.

```{r}
df <- read.csv("../data/wk2_SPY.csv")
str(df)
```
## Statistics of S&P daily prices

+ The average daily closing price of the S&P index during this period is `r round(100*sum(df$close), 2)`%.

+ The standard deviation of the daily closing price of the S&P index during this period is `r round(100*sd(df$close), 2)`%.
