## Exercise with data

Download `wk2_SPY.csv` from Canvas. The data contain daily closing
prices, returns, and volume for S&P 500 index (SPY) from the web. Read
it into `R`.

``` r
df <- read.csv("../data/wk2_SPY.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
